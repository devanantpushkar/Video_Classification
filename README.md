**Video Classification using CNN with Attention**

A deep learning-based system for classifying video content into three categories: General, Obscene, and Violent, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with optional Spatial Attention. Built with TensorFlow + Keras and deployed with a user-friendly Streamlit interface. Supports both video uploads and real-time screen monitoring.

**Features**

Keyframe Extraction using PyAV (I-frames)
Frame-by-Frame Classification using CNN
Spatial Attention Layer for focused learning
-Streamlit Web Interface for:
Video Upload
Real-time Screen Monitoring
Aggregated Prediction using Averaging + Threshold Voting

**Dataset**

Total Labeled Keyframes: ~2,500 images
Classes: General, Obscene, Violent
Split:
2,000 for training (80%)
500 for validation (20%)
Source: Frames manually labeled from various public videos

**Approach**

Frame Extraction:
Use either fixed rate (1 frame/sec) or keyframe extraction (I-frames using PyAV).

Preprocessing:
Resize to 256x256
Normalize pixel values to range [0, 1]

Model Prediction:
CNN model processes each frame and predicts class probabilities.
Optional Spatial Attention layer enhances focus on important frame regions.

Prediction Aggregation:
Average all frame predictions
OR count frames with >80% confidence for a class (threshold voting)

Final Classification:
If majority frames show high probability for Obscene or Violent, raise alert
Otherwise, label as General
