How It Works
The video classification process follows these main steps:

Input Acquisition: Videos can be provided either by uploading a local file or by capturing a live screen stream.
Keyframe Extraction: For the given video or stream, intelligent keyframe extraction identifies and isolates the most significant frames.
Preprocessing: Each extracted keyframe is resized, normalized (e.g., to a [0, 1] range), and prepared for model input.
Frame-level Prediction: The preprocessed keyframes are fed into the trained CNN model, which predicts the class (General, Obscene, Violent) for each individual frame.
Prediction Aggregation: The individual frame predictions are aggregated using statistical methods (e.g., averaging probabilities, majority voting based on thresholds) to determine the final classification label for the entire video.
User Interface Display: The classification result, along with any relevant metrics, is displayed in a clear and user-friendly manner via the Streamlit web application.
Model Architecture
The core of the classification system is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). While the exact architecture can vary, a typical structure might involve several convolutional and pooling layers to extract spatial features, followed by fully connected layers for classification. The model is trained to distinguish between the three defined categories.

A simplified representation of the model's architecture could be:

Input Layer (e.g., 224x224x3 - RGB image)
├── Conv2D(32 filters, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu')
├── MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2))
├── Conv2D(64 filters, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu')
├── MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2))
├── Flatten()
├── Dense(128 units, activation='relu')
├── Dropout(0.5)  # For regularization
└── Dense(3 units, activation='softmax') # Output layer for 3 classes
The model.h5 file contains the pre-trained weights for this CNN model, allowing for immediate inference.

Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python: Version 3.9 or higher. You can check your Python version using python --version. If not installed, download it from python.org.
Git: For cloning the repository.
Setup Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/devanantpushkar/Video_Classification.git
cd Video_Classification
Create a virtual environment: It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies: All required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt.

pip install -r requirements.txt
The model.h5 file, which contains the pre-trained model, is included in the repository's root directory, so no separate download is required.

Usage
You can use the system via its Streamlit web interface or by integrating its core functionalities into your Python scripts.

Using the Streamlit Web App
To launch the web application for video classification:

Activate your virtual environment (if not already active):

macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Run the Streamlit app:

For offline video uploads:
streamlit run app.py
For real-time screen monitoring and classification:
streamlit run screen_reader_app.py
Once the command is executed, a new tab will open in your web browser displaying the Streamlit application. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload a video or start screen monitoring.

Programmatic Usage
The core classification logic can also be used directly in your Python scripts. Here's an example demonstrating how you might use the prediction.py module to classify a video file:

import os
from prediction import VideoClassifier

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Ensure the model path is correct
    model_path = 'model.h5'
    if not os.path.exists(model_path):
        print(f"Error: Model file not found at {model_path}")
        print("Please ensure 'model.h5' is in the root directory of the project.")
    else:
        # Initialize the VideoClassifier
        # (This assumes VideoClassifier takes a model path and possibly other configs)
        classifier = VideoClassifier(model_path=model_path)

        # Example: Classify an offline video
        video_file_path = 'path/to/your/video.mp4' # Replace with your video file
        if os.path.exists(video_file_path):
            print(f"Classifying video: {video_file_path}")
            # The exact method might vary (e.g., classify_file, process_video)
            # This is a hypothetical example based on common patterns.
            try:
                results = classifier.classify_video_from_path(video_file_path)
                print("\n--- Classification Results ---")
                print(f"Video: {video_file_path}")
                print(f"Predicted Label: {results['label']}")
                print(f"Confidence Scores: {results['scores']}")
                # You might get more detailed results depending on implementation
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"An error occurred during classification: {e}")
        else:
            print(f"Error: Video file not found at {video_file_path}")
            print("Please provide a valid path to a video file for programmatic classification.")

        # Example for real-time (more complex, involves capturing frames)
        # For real-time screen capture, you would typically use screen_reader_app.py
        # as it handles the MSS integration and continuous processing.
        # Programmatic real-time usage would involve directly using MSS and feeding frames.
        # This is typically handled by the Streamlit app for user convenience.
Note: The exact method names (classify_video_from_path, results['label'], etc.) are illustrative. Please refer to the source code (prediction.py, main.py) for precise API details.

1. Introduction
This project focuses on classifying video content into three categories: General, Obscene, and Violent using deep learning. We utilize a CNN-based architecture enhanced with optional spatial attention and provide a Streamlit web interface to classify both uploaded videos and real-time screen content. With growing concern over inappropriate or harmful content, such tools offer scalable solutions for automated moderation.

2. Problem Statement
Manual content moderation is time-consuming, inconsistent, and inefficient. Automating the classification of sensitive content in videos can benefit surveillance, parental control, and platform moderation.

3. Objectives
Build an accurate CNN model for per-frame classification.

Aggregate frame predictions for final video labeling.

Support keyframe-based and fixed-frame extraction.

Integrate real-time screen classification.

Explore ViT and ResNet for advanced modeling.

4. Technologies Used
TensorFlow / Keras: Model training and architecture

OpenCV: Frame extraction and preprocessing

PyAV: Keyframe (I-frame) extraction

MSS: Screen capture for real-time classification

Streamlit: Web-based user interface

5. Dataset Overview
Total Labeled Keyframes: ~2,500

Categories: General, Obscene, Violent

Train-Test Split: 80/20 (2,000 train, 500 test)

6. Feature Extraction Techniques
Fixed Frame Extraction: 1 frame per second

Keyframe Extraction: Using I-frames via PyAV

Keyframes provide scene-representative information, reducing redundancy.

7. Frame Preprocessing
Resize to 256x256 pixels

Normalize pixel values to range [0, 1]

Convert to RGB format

8. CNN-Based Architecture
Input: 256x256x3 RGB frame
Conv2D(32) -> MaxPooling2D
Conv2D(64) -> MaxPooling2D
[Spatial Attention Layer - Optional]
Flatten -> Dense(128) -> Dense(3, softmax)
Output: Probabilities for each class

9. Spatial Attention Mechanism
The attention layer focuses on "where" the model should look by multiplying feature maps with an importance mask. It highlights areas of the image critical for classification.

10. Model Training
Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

Epochs: 10 (early stopping)

Batch Size: 32

Regularization: Dropout(0.5)

Training Summary:
Trained using TensorFlow + Keras

Dataset manually labeled into 3 classes

Training images: 2000

Validation images: 500

Accuracy achieved: ~83%

11. Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score per class

Confusion Matrix

12. Aggregating Predictions
Average Probabilities: Mean of all frame outputs

Threshold Voting: Count of frames with probability > 0.8

Combine both methods for final label

13. Real-Time Monitoring with Screen Reader
Uses MSS to take screenshots

Runs classification every few seconds

Triggers alert if violent/obscene content detected (>80%)

14. Alternate Approaches
Instead of fixed intervals, color histograms can detect scene changes to choose frames. This provides a smarter selection of representative frames.

15. Vision Transformer (ViT) for Video Classification
Concept:
ViT treats image patches as a sequence of tokens and applies transformer attention blocks, similar to how words are handled in NLP.

Key Features:
Image split into patches (e.g., 16x16)

Flattened patches are embedded and given positional encoding

Multi-head self-attention helps focus on important patches

Final token used for classification

Benefits:
Better global context than CNNs

Superior performance on large and complex datasets

No inductive bias like locality in CNNs

16. Understanding Vision Transformer in Depth
ViT breaks each image into small patches (e.g., 16x16 pixels), flattens each patch into a vector, and treats these like words in a sentence. Then it uses self-attention layers (just like in BERT) to decide which patches are important and how they relate to each other.

Mathematically:

Let image 
𝑥
∈
𝑅
𝐻
×
𝑊
×
𝐶
x∈R 
H×W×C
 

Divide into patches of size 
𝑃
×
𝑃
P×P, total patches = 
𝑁
=
𝐻
𝑊
𝑃
2
N= 
P 
2
 
HW
​
 

Apply learnable embedding + positional encoding

Pass through transformer encoder

Output used for classification

17. Applying Vision Transformer in Our Project
To apply ViT:

Replace CNN with pretrained ViT from Hugging Face or TensorFlow Hub

Resize and patchify frames

Fine-tune on our 3-class dataset

Aggregate predictions as before (avg or threshold)

Pros in Our Case:
Excellent for detecting patterns spread across the frame

More robust to complex backgrounds

Transfer learning boosts performance

18. Using ResNet for Classification
Architecture:
ResNet uses residual connections to train very deep networks without vanishing gradient

Example: ResNet50 has 50 layers and is often used as a feature extractor

Application:
Use pretrained ResNet50 (ImageNet)

Add Dense(128) + Dense(3) on top

Freeze lower layers or fine-tune whole network

19. Detailed ResNet Architecture for Our Use Case
model = Sequential([
  ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(256, 256, 3)),
  GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
  Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  Dropout(0.5),
  Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])
GlobalAveragePooling summarizes feature maps

Final Dense layer outputs class probabilities

20. Comparative Analysis: CNN vs ViT vs ResNet
Model	Strengths	Weaknesses
CNN	Fast, local features	Misses global context
ViT	Captures global patterns	Needs more data/training
ResNet	Deep learning with residuals	Larger, slower to train
21. Deployment and Streamlit Integration
